# cybercirmes-feature-selection
This repo creates a model to detect cybercrimes using optimization function like GA (genetic alogrithm) and PSO (particle swarm algorithm) as a feature selsction then train the model in different machine learning algorithms. 

 The dataset used in the models is <a href='https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/spambase/spambase.data'> sambase dataset </a> dataset
